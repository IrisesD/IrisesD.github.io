Hi, it's Cheng Ding. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and I'm currently a research intern at UIUC working with Prof. Tianyin Xu and Prof. Owolabi Legunsen on Runtime Verification.

My research interests are in software engineering and systems, with an emphasis on developing guarantees for the reliability of programs. I am applying for a Ph.D. program starting from 2024Fall.
