Hi, it's Cheng Ding. 

I'm a first year ECE PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin(UT Austin), advised by Prof. [Milos Gligoric](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/). 

I got my Bachelor degree at the University of Science of Technology of China(USTC). I was previously a research intern at UIUC working with Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) and Prof. [Owolabi Legunsen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~legunsen/) on Runtime Verification.

My research interests are in **software testing, verification and machine learning**.
